# Database Types: RDBMS, Unstructured & Graph Databases

## Slide 1: Introduction
- **Modern Data Storage Requirements**
  - Data volume growing exponentially
  - Need for different storage paradigms
  - Performance vs. flexibility tradeoffs
- **Today's Focus:**
  - Core database technologies
  - Key strengths and limitations
  - Use cases and practical applications

## Slide 2: The Evolution of Database Systems
- **Early Days:** File-based systems
- **1970s:** Relational model (RDBMS) emerges
- **2000s:** NoSQL movement begins
- **Today:** Multi-model approach
  - Purpose-built solutions
  - Polyglot persistence
  - Hybrid architectures

## Slide 3: Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
- **Core Characteristics:**
  - Data organized in tables (relations)
  - Schema-based with predefined structure
  - ACID compliance (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
  - SQL as standard query language
- **Key Technologies:**
  - PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server
  - Transactions and joins
  - Normalization principles

## Slide 4: RDBMS Strengths & Limitations
- **Strengths:**
  - Data integrity and consistency
  - Well-established, mature ecosystem
  - Powerful querying capabilities
  - Transaction support
  - Ideal for financial and ERP systems
- **Limitations:**
  - Rigid schema limits flexibility
  - Scaling challenges (especially horizontal)
  - Not ideal for semi-structured data
  - Complex joins impact performance at scale

## Slide 5: Unstructured Databases (NoSQL)
- **Core Characteristics:**
  - Schema-less or schema-flexible design
  - Horizontal scalability
  - Various data models:
    - Document stores (MongoDB, CouchDB)
    - Key-value stores (Redis, DynamoDB)
    - Wide-column stores (Cassandra, HBase)
  - BASE principles vs. ACID

## Slide 6: Unstructured Database Strengths & Limitations
- **Strengths:**
  - Flexibility for evolving data needs
  - Horizontal scaling capabilities
  - High performance for specific workloads
  - Excellent for rapid development cycles
  - Ideal for content management, IoT, real-time apps
- **Limitations:**
  - Limited transaction support
  - Query capabilities often less powerful than SQL
  - Eventual consistency challenges
  - Less mature tooling ecosystem

## Slide 7: Graph Databases
- **Core Characteristics:**
  - Data stored as nodes, edges, and properties
  - Relationships are first-class citizens
  - Focus on connected data patterns
  - Traversal-based queries
- **Key Technologies:**
  - Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, JanusGraph
  - Cypher, Gremlin query languages
  - Property graphs vs. RDF triples

## Slide 8: Graph Database Strengths & Limitations
- **Strengths:**
  - Natural representation of connected data
  - Efficient relationship traversal
  - Powerful for path finding and pattern detection
  - Ideal for recommendation engines, fraud detection, networks
- **Limitations:**
  - Steeper learning curve
  - Less suitable for transactional workloads
  - Scaling challenges for some implementations
  - Specialized skill requirements

## Slide 9: Choosing the Right Database
- **Selection Criteria:**
  - Data structure and relationships
  - Query complexity and patterns
  - Scale requirements
  - Consistency needs
  - Development velocity
- **Modern Approach:** Polyglot persistence
  - Use multiple database types
  - Match data store to use case
  - Data integration challenges

## Slide 10: Preparing for Hands-On Sessions
- **Upcoming Practical Labs:**
  - RDBMS: PostgreSQL - data modeling, normalization, SQL
  - Document DB: MongoDB - collections, CRUD, aggregation
  - Graph DB: Neo4j - modeling connected data, Cypher queries
- **Pre-requisites:**
  - Docker environment setup
  - Basic query language familiarity 
  - Sample datasets (available online)
